Born and raised in the city of Los Angeles, California, I have worked for several years developing software as both a hobbyist and as a professional. Leveraging the latest and greatest technologies, I'm able to take your product from idea to reality in record time.

Beginning with scripting for video games I played, I have transitioned to web development after attending Lambda School: an online course dedicated for web development. There, I honed my skills designing and creating web applications.

In my free time, I love to play video games on my computer, stay up late working on my personal projects, or just go out with friends.
