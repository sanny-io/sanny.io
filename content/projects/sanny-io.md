description: The site you're viewing right now! I designed and developed it myself.
details: >-
  This website was both designed and developed myself. This was actually my
  first project using TypeScript instead of JavaScript. I have some experience
  with C#, so I appreciate the many similarities between the two -- and the
  safety, of course. ðŸ˜…

   I've gone through many iterations of this site, but it feels like no matter what I do, I keep coming back and trying to make it better. I guess it's because my name is literally attached to it, so I'm compelled to scrutinize every little thing. What it allows me to do, though, is experiment with new things I find and see how I like it.
