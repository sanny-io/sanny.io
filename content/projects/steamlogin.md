description: >-
  This library makes logging in through \[Steam](https://steamcommunity.com) a
  breeze, and works in just about any project.


  No knowledge of OpenID 2.0 required.
details: >-
  Steam is the most popular platform for PC gaming. Despite this, it's unusually
  difficult to find information regarding how to authenticate users with it.


  Steam allows third-party authentication of users, but uses an old and now obsolete technology - OpenID 2.0. In my search for how to get everything working, I grew frustrated with results that turned up about "OpenID Connect," which is actually a completely different thing that doesn't work with OpenID 2.0.


  After a long and arduous process, I have succeeded in understanding how to get the Steam authentication working, and have made available a library that couldn't possibly make it easier.


  Cheers for hopefully nobody ever going through this madness again ðŸ¥³
