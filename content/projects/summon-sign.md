  Dark Souls is a video game series notorious for how difficult it can be.
  Fortunately, it includes multiplayer mechanics that allows players to "summon"
  each other. Through this, players can enter the game of another player, and
  assist them in defeating a boss or progressing through an area.


  However, these helpers (called phantoms) must place a physical sign in the game world. These summon signs can be easily missed by other players due to the size of the game world and some rules that stipulate whether the sign appears at all for others. Unfortunately, this often means that players who require assistance may find it rather difficult to acquire any.


  There is a reddit community dedicated to connecting phantoms with these players. This web application polls the /r/summonsign subreddit and allows phantoms to specify which game, platform, and boss they are available to help with.


  Additionally, this application highlights pertinent information that helps phantoms connect with the player in-game, and can even notify phantoms when a player is in need of one.
