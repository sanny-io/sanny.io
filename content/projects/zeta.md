description: A comprehensive framework for developing Garry's Mod addons.
details: >-
  An object-oriented framework, \*\*zeta\*\* lets you quickly bootstrap new
  addons. It includes multiple database driver implementations, an Active Record
  style ORM, a network message chunking system, helper functions to layout user
  interfaces, and much more.


  I named this project after the letter "Z", considering it the last framework I'd need in this area of programming. That, and because it's easy to type with just your left hand, which I had to do quite frequently.


  This is my most complex personal project to date.
