description: >-
  I worked on some of the company's largest server administration products used
  by thousands of customers, and was the principal developer for implementing
  many parts of the user interface provided by the design team.


  My responsibilities included refactoring and maintaining code written by previous developers, expanding upon it with new features, responding to customer inquiries, engaging with customers in developing a community around our products, and deploying builds to simplify customer access to the latest versions of our products.
