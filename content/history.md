                I served as a developer and maintainer for the company's flagship roleplaying game.

                The design and development of numerous features provided were contributed by me, including an easy-to-use configuration interface for customers to manage their servers. Additionally, I investigated problems in relation to game updates, and provided customer/technical support through an online ticketing system.
