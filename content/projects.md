                The site you're viewing right now! I made it myself.
    details: |
            This website was both designed and developed myself. Normally, I'd make sites like these in plain JavaScript and CSS, but I specifically wanted to show my experience with the toolsets I'm most familiar with. This was actually my first site made using TypeScript. I have some experience with C#, so I appreciate the many similarities between the two -- and the safety, of course. ðŸ˜…

            I've gone through many iterations of this site, but it feels like no matter what I do, I keep coming back and trying to make it better. I guess it's because my name is literally attached to it, so I'm compelled to scrutinize every little thing. What it allows me to do, though, is experiment with new things I find and see how I like it.

            Tailwind was one of those things. Now I use it in every new project I make.

                This web application assists Dark Souls players in locating others who need help.
    details: |
            Dark Souls is a video game series notorious for how difficult it can be. Fortunately, it includes multiplayer mechanics that allows players to "summon" each other. Through this, players can enter the game of another player, and assist them in defeating a boss or progressing through an area.

            However, these helpers (called phantoms) must place a physical sign in the game world. These summon signs can be easily missed by other players due to the size of the game world and some rules that stipulate whether the sign appears at all for others. Unfortunately, this often means that players who require assistance may find it rather difficult to acquire any.

            There is a reddit community dedicated to connecting phantoms with these players. This web application polls the /r/summonsign subreddit and allows phantoms to specify which game, platform, and boss they are available to help with.

            Additionally, this application highlights pertinent information that helps phantoms connect with the player in-game, and can even notify phantoms when a player is in need of one.
