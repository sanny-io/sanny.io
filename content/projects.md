                The site you're viewing right now! I designed and developed it myself.
    details: |
            This website was both designed and developed myself. This was actually my first project using TypeScript instead of JavaScript. I have some experience with C#, so I appreciate the many similarities between the two -- and the safety, of course. ðŸ˜…

            I've gone through many iterations of this site, but it feels like no matter what I do, I keep coming back and trying to make it better. I guess it's because my name is literally attached to it, so I'm compelled to scrutinize every little thing. What it allows me to do, though, is experiment with new things I find and see how I like it.

            Tailwind was one of those things. Now I use it in every new project I make.

                This web application assists Dark Souls players in locating others who need help.

                *"If you require help on your travels, I offer you my sign. Blessing of the moon upon your journey."*
    details: |
            Dark Souls is a video game series notorious for how difficult it can be. Fortunately, it includes multiplayer mechanics that allows players to "summon" each other. Through this, players can enter the game of another player, and assist them in defeating a boss or progressing through an area.

            However, these helpers (called phantoms) must place a physical sign in the game world. These summon signs can be easily missed by other players due to the size of the game world and some rules that stipulate whether the sign appears at all for others. Unfortunately, this often means that players who require assistance may find it rather difficult to acquire any.

            There is a reddit community dedicated to connecting phantoms with these players. This web application polls the /r/summonsign subreddit and allows phantoms to specify which game, platform, and boss they are available to help with.

            Additionally, this application highlights pertinent information that helps phantoms connect with the player in-game, and can even notify phantoms when a player is in need of one.

            This was my first project made using Next.js, and I must say, it's absolutely incredible. With every new project, the first
            thing I look forward to is using Next.js and having the development and deployment processes flow so much smoother than
            if I had worked with Create React App.

                This library makes logging in through [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com) a breeze, and works in just about any project.

                No knowledge of OpenID 2.0 required.
    details: |
            Steam is the most popular platform for PC gaming. Despite this, it's unusually difficult to find information regarding how to authenticate users with it.

            Steam allows third-party authentication of users, but uses an old and now obsolete technology - OpenID 2.0. In my search for how to get everything working, I grew frustrated with results that turned up about "OpenID Connect," which is actually a completely different thing that doesn't work with OpenID 2.0.

            After a long and arduous process, I have succeeded in understanding how to get the Steam authentication working, and have made available a library that couldn't possibly make it easier.

            Cheers for hopefully nobody ever going through this madness again ðŸ¥³

                A comprehensive framework for developing Garry's Mod addons.
    details: |
            An object-oriented framework, **zeta** lets you quickly bootstrap new addons. It includes multiple database driver implementations, an Active Record style ORM, a network message chunking system, helper functions to layout user interfaces, and much more.

            I named this project after the letter "Z", considering it the last framework I'd need in this area of programming. That, and because it's easy to type with just your left hand, which I had to do quite frequently.

            This is my most complex personal project to date.
